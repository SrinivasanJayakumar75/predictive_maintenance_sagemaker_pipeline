# predictive_maintenance_sagemaker_pipeline

1: Used sageMaker studio to perform experimentation and feature engineering to
analyze whether a machine will fail based on input data.

2: Then performed the preprocessing using sagemaker processing jobs,
trained the XGBOOST model with the help of sagemaker training jobs and
orchestrated a sagemaker pipeline.

3: Builded an HTTP API using Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda
function to invoke the Amazon SageMaker endpoint for inference. Then used a
web client to invoke the HTTP API and performed inference.

https://reqbin.com/ is used to perform inference
